	Creates a sounddevice InputStream and records audio to a queue. This function

	# samplerate=sample_rate, channels=channels)

	# Okay, to avoid the stopping issues, I'm going to try and use the raw
	# InputStream provided by sounddevice for recording.
	# https://python-sounddevice.readthedocs.io/en/0.4.6/api/streams.html#sounddevice.InputStream
	# A more practical example (which I based this on) is
	# https://python-sounddevice.readthedocs.io/en/0.4.6/examples.html#plot-microphone-signal-s-in-real-time 

	# First, define the callback that PortAudio will call while the stream is
	# running. PortAudio will call this and provide as many frames as we specify,
	# and it's the job of this callback to take those frames and put them
	# somewhere.
	# Callback signature as provided in docs.

	# "The PortAudio stream callback runs at very high or real-time priority. It
	# is required to consistently meet its time deadlines. Do not allocate
	# memory, access the file system, call library functions or call other
	# functions from the stream callback that may block or take an unpredictable
	# amount of time to complete."

	# THE ABOVE is important, because it means: we want to push the data that
	# PortAudio passes to this callback to a data structure that we don't have to
	# wait to use--like a queue shared by multiple threads. Obtaining the lock
	# could lead to unpredictable wait times--which screws up PortAudio.

	# Instead, we create a separate queue for "callback use only," which we'll
	# then grab items from and push to our shared array. So sure--it's another
	# intermediary data structure, but necessary.

	mic_callback_queue = queue.Queue()

	def mic_callback(indata: np.ndarray, frames: int, time, status) -> None:
		assert len(indata) == frames
		# Use special slice to make sure we're pushing a COPY of the indata
		# values to our queue.
		mic_callback_queue.put(indata[:])

	# Next, we actually need to define the stream that we're going to "connect"
	# or point at the default input device. Starting a stream basically means
	# firing up a thread where PortAudio (a C/C++ Audio I/O library) runs and
	# takes data from inputs / writes data to outputs. The stream we define is a
	# convenient framework for telling PortAudio what to do!

	# In this case, we'll define a special case of the normal Stream called
	# InputStream. This is just a normal stream, but we can only read from it, as
	# it is just telling PortAudio to grab the data provided by our microphone
	# and hand it off to us (normal streams can connect to multiple input and/or
	# output devices--we don't need/want that for our input!).

	mic_stream = sd.InputStream(samplerate=SAMPLE_RATE, channels=CHANNELS, callback=mic_callback)

	# How do I start the stream? Well, the __enter__ functionality
	# (executed when we use it with "with") calls "self.start" -- and that's what
	# they do in all th examples--so I'll follow that.

		# recording_queue as soon as new data is available.

		# https://python-sounddevice.readthedocs.io/en/0.4.6/examples.html#recording-with-arbitrary-duration
		# The above example mimics this most closely--we're we want to wake up
		# this thread to wait on the queue's condition until woken up by the
		# PortAudio (Stream) thread that is going to put more data in the
		# mic_callback_queue via the callback function.
